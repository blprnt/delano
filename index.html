        Library of Congress Labs
      </h3-->
      <p class="intro">
        In 2018, The Library of Congress released its first agency-wide digital
        strategy. At the center of the document was a promise: to throw open the
        “treasure chest”. The Library’s digital holdings add up to nearly 200
        petabytes. Photographs, films, source, code, recipes, architectural
        drawings, websites, newspapers, and digital recordings made from wax
        cylinders.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the new digital strategy, the Library would grow these digital
        holdings exponentially, ramping up digitization work and bolstering
        born-digital collections. The plan would also see many more of materials
        made available online, by putting them in the cloud for anyone to
        download.

        As an institution, the LOC had long served people who visited in person,
        unrolling maps and spreading out books on the tables of its twenty
        reading rooms and research centers. Now it wanted to serve a slice of
        the public, people who needed API keys instead of Reader ID cards and
        server space more than desk space.

        McClellan built Speculative Annotation, a dynamic website which allows
        students and teachers to annotate items from the Library’s collection,
        including rare books, maps, photographs and political posters. Through
        their annotations, students enter into conversation with historical
        materials, and find opportunity to both explore and to question what is
        contained in data about primary sources.

        Yoo Warren, an artist and educator from Rhode Island, used archival
        photos and records from the LOC collection to make “hidden portals”,
        immersive 3D reconstructions of Chinese American and Korean American
        communities. Sited in the geographic locations where these communities
        once existed, the portals offer a high-tech reminder of how many
        histories have been hidden in plain sight.

        Scholars like Lincoln Mullen.

       <div

      <p>
        A historian of American Religion, Mullen uses computational methods to
        analyze text and music. For his project America’s Public Bible, Mullen
        wrote code to process millions of newspaper pages from the LOC’s
        collection, looking for bible quotes. The project uncovers trends and
        patterns in these citations, on a scale that would be invisible to
        scholars using non-computational approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        A year after the release of the Digital Strategy, the Library invited
        Mullen and two other researchers - Lauren Tilton and Andromeda Yelton -
        to take part in a case study project called Computing Cultural History
        in the Cloud (CCHC). The goal was to figure out just exactly how the
        Library’s treasure chest would be thrown open: how the library could
        serve computational research requests while being realistic about its
        institutional capabilities, and mindful of potential risks and harms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CCHC project started off centered on mostly technical concerns:

        class="caption pile3 scrollStep"
        style="width: 370px; left: 100px; top:-50px; transform: rotate(3deg)"
      >
        What data formats were most useful to researchers?
      </div>
      <div
        class="caption pile3"
        style="width: 370px; left: 10px; top:-20px; transform: rotate(-3deg)"
      >
         Could the library offer computing resources to help with data analysis?
      </div>
      <div
        class="caption pile3"
        style="width: 370px; left: 60px; transform: rotate(2deg); margin-bottom:100px"
      >
         What staffing changes would be needed to support these new kinds of requests? 
      </div>
      

      <p>
        Yelton, Tilton and Mullen got to work. They pulled data and coded
        frameworks, designed interfaces and sharpened research questions.
        Watching their work closely, the CCHC staff gleaned valuable insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        They learned, for example, that digital researchers were likely to come
        to the Library with their own frameworks, workflows, and software
        stacks. The researchers wanted the modes of access to the data to be
        robust and well documented, but they weren’t overly concerned with the
        format the data came to them in. There was no one-size-fits-all answer
        to their technical needs, no file format or delivery method that would
        work for each of them, let alone for tens of thousands of potential new
        Library users.

      <p>That last one is me.</p>
      <p>
        When I came to Washington for my first day as Innovator in Residence in
        2017, I was prepared with a stack of ideas of how I’d use the Library’s
        data. I was enamored by the scale of it all: hundreds of thousands
        photographs, three centuries of catalogue records, two city blocks of
        flat file cabinets filled with maps. Like the CCHC researchers I came
        with my own tools, sharpened and ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the eighteen months I spent there, I’d learned one very important
        thing. I learned it over and over, in different ways. It’s something
        that you’ll learn too if you spend enough time in the treasure chest.
        You’ll learn it from from rare codexes, from web archives, from FORTRAN
        code on floppy disks. Even more so, you’ll learn it from librarians and
        archivists and historians. You’ll find it right at the heart of the
        CCHC’s report and in the meaningful data packages the Library is
        releasing:
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Library’s data shouldn’t be - that it can’t be - separated from
        its context.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <div class="caption scrollStep pile2" style="width: 290px; left: 40px; top:-0px;">
        That meaning comes from place

        style="width: 150px; left: 340px; margin-top: 100px; top:-70px;"

        and people.
